Of you and all this, of the shots that were fired<br>

Outside of myself my heavy soul’s reeling<br>

La Meduse sings out with that very same feeling<br>

of hopelessness, but I’m hopeful instead<br>

because as of now my raft isn’t yet dead<br><br>

look over there past the forest unspoiled<br>

the song of those shipwrecked sailors foiled<br>

trapped in a culture that leaves them behind<br>

decays and kills, but we pay it no mind.<br>

too good too naive, so naive that it’s fun,<br>

oh just too naïve. . ., they’re dead, it’s done.<br><br>


Bataclan to Orlando, across the seas<br>

Our shares and our homages cannot ease--<br>

Just words that do nothing but please the ear<br>

We watch another shipwreck capsize here<br>

In our Western society, the very one<br>

That’s loading the bullets inside of its gun."; }
